## Experience

I found this project to be much more enlightening on the back-end parts of the website creation.
Having some experience from the previous project helped me understand the basic structure, and the 
newer implementation this project introduced.

I worked with the css formatting a little more in this project as well, that I neglected slightly in the
last project. I found that I lost some of the CSS skills that we utilized in previous projects, and 
I was able to job my memory with CSS a lot better.

In terms of the merging, that was not as bad as I was expecting, there were some minor issues, and I found that
merging in GitHub sometimes does not feel very helpful in how to work around the issues, and just 
expects you to know how to fix it, without completely altering the code, but as I do some hobby
projects through GitHub (i.e. game development with a buddy), I found it very useful to understand 
how version control is used with other developers.

## Known issues or Bugs

I do not believe there are any issues or bugs in the student1 section of the project.
