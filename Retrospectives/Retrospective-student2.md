## Experience

I actually had quite a bit of fun with this project and I feel as if I have learned quite a lot. I apologize for missing
one of the virtual standup meetings, but I still think I got a small taste of what it's like to code with a team.

The most confusing part of the project for me, or at least the part that took the most time was figuring out how to implement
the comment page functionality into my whole page. I ended up borrowing code from my groupmates and altering it a bit to make it 
work for my page and other than that everything else went very smoothly and I feel like I was able to work through stuff quite 
quickly.

## Known issues or Bugs

I haven't come across any bugs or issues

## Sources used

I utilized code from my groupmates for the back-end and then I also used a couple of ZyBook sections. I also used w3schools.com
for simple syntax questions, especially CSS-related.
