## Experience

This project went mostly smoothly, I had a few small issues throughout the project but I was ultimately able to resolve all of them. My webpage was able to be fully functional and was able to fulfill all the requirements that were outlined in the README. I thought the instructions were mostly clear and simple to follow, the only things I wasn't entirely certain about was if there were any type of preferences for the specific content on the webpage. I created my major around the default listed major that was listed in student3. I wasn't sure if we were free to pick any random major or if we had to create it based around the default major. Since it wasn't explicitly outlined in the README I thought I would just play it safe and do the default major. Most of the uncertainity I had with the assignment was mainly around what type of content was expected for the major so I mainly saved doing it all for last. It seemed like there was an implication that the content could be as serious / lighthearted as we wanted but it would've been nice just to have an explicit statement saying that somewhere. Besides that I thought the project was easy to follow, and overall it was a fun experience implementing both the frontend and backend. It was fun coding the different aspects of the project, I don't usually do any sort of web development for my personal projects so it was a very new experience for me. Overall I thought this class, and final project did a very good job touching on the many different aspects of web development.
